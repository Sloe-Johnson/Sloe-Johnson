- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sloe-Johnson, irl Arianna Zuanazzi, a biomedical engineering Bachelor student at University of Padova.
- 👀 Career-wise I'm interested in bioinstrumentation, imaging technology, sensor technology and optics. 
- In my free time I enjoy astronomy, scifi, poetry writing, cooking and singing. I also have an interest in linguistics and genetics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning beginner Python, with the hope to move to the basics of bioinformatics and then medical data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to medicine, language or signals. 
- 📫 You can reach me here on GitHub!
